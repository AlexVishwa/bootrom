Build:
The boot ROM code can only be built under Linux. Tested build environment is
Ubuntu 14.04.

To build the code, do:
    ./configure <chip_name>
    make

The <chip_name> defaults to "tsb" if not specified. This is for the official
Toshiba UniPro Bridge chips (both APBridge and GPBridge).

Other available configurations include:
    es1tsb  - to build image to run on ES1 chip (in workram)
    fpgatsb - to build image to run on HAPS board, with ES3 FPGA bits
